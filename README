sshfs -- An sftp translator (remote file system) for GNU Hurd

1. Usage

settrans [-a] file /path/to/sshfs sftp://[user@]host/path

where [...] means optional arguments. Note that the passward shall not be included in the 
URL for security reasons. If it is started as an active translator (started manually with 
-a) , then it can be used with passward authetication. If it is used as a passive 
translator (started automatically, without -a), then only publickey authetication with 
empyty passphrase is allowed, because a passive translator cannot read a password from 
the console

2. Dependence

This program depends on the libvfs library in the hurd-libvfs repo
